649 kinds of cars, 
33 different parts, 
studied correlation to figure out if there's a connection between different parts, 
looked into the variance to order the assembly station, 
but noticed issue with this approach because of varying amounts of parts in categories, 
hence calculated and introduced variance coefficient and got the relative standard deviation, 
ordered the stations correctly, 
calculated usage data grouped by different part types and used it to allocate stock, 
noticed a U trend (show a graph here ) and found the optimal value for the restock to trigger by automating the min value detection, 
// detail KPIs but also keep throwing them in between the slides to make it non technical, 

// add the part about 150.
